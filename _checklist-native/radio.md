### **Developer Notes**

- Use a Radio Button when the user needs to choose between more than two states
- You should use a native element rather than a custom element because it will announce the correct built-in screen reader announcements without additional development effort
- A Radio Button should just toggle between selected and unselected. Toggling can add related content to screen.  It should not automatically navigate the user to another field or screen, which would be a change of context
    
### Name

- Name describes purpose while focus is in/on the control
- Name should match the visible label

- **iOS Tips**
	- Set a label in Interface Builder in the Identity Inspector
	- Group visible text label and the control in the same view container: `accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace`
	- `setTitle( )` method
	- If no visible label, use `accessibilityLabel` on control
	- `Hint` is used only if the results of interacting with it are not obvious from the control's label
	- Match visible label, if any
	- To hide labels from VoiceOver announcements, uncheck the Accessibility Enabled checkbox in the Identity Inspector or use `isAccessibilityElement=false`
	- If hiding visible label, use accessibilityLabel on control
- **Android Tips**  
	- `android:text` XML attribute
	- Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements without a visible label
	- `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`  
	- Use `labelFor` attribute to connect the visible label to the control

### Role

- Role is automatically announced if a native component is used

- **iOS Tips**
	- Standard NSRadioButton
	- Announce as "button"
- **Android Tips**
	- Standard RadioButton with RadioGroup when applicable
	- "double tap to activate" is expected announcement

### Groupings

- Group visible label with radio button (if label is visible)

- **iOS Tips**
	- `accessibilityFrame`
	- `accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace`
	- GroupView
	- Only the container class is an accessible element `isAccessibilityElement=true` and announces all elements in one announcement  This makes child elements no longer accessible by screen reader 
- **Android Tips**
	- ViewGroup
	- Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement

### State

- States can be selected, dimmed/disabled, checked/unchecked, expands/collapses, on/off

- **iOS Tips**  
	- Active: `isEnabled property`
	- Disabled: `UIAccessibilityTraitNotEnabled`
	- disabled/dimmed
	- on/off:  `isOn` or `setOn`   
	- Announcement: dimmed, selected  
        
- **Android Tips**
	- Active: `android:enabled=true`
	- Disabled: `android:enabled=false`
	- on/off: `isChecked`, `setChecked`
	- Announcement: disabled, checked/not checked

### Focus

- Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus order.
- Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views or containers

- **iOS Tips**
	- `accessibilityElementIsFocused`  
	- `isAccessibilityElement` makes the element visible or not to the Accessibility API
	- `accessibilityElementsHidden` indicates that the children elements of the target element are visible or not to the Accessibility API
	- `accessibilityViewIsModal` contains the screen reader focus inside the Modal
	- To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification`
	- To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification`
- **Android Tips**
	- `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API
	- `android:focusable`
	- `android=clickable`
	- Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, not `onTouch( )`
	- `nextFocusDown`
	- `nextFocusUp`
	- `nextFocusRight`
	- `nextFocusLeft`
	- `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)
	- To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`
	- To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)
	- To hide controls: `Important_For_Accessibility_false`
