## Developer Notes

- Switch or Toggle Button - A switch is a visual toggle between two mutually exclusive states â€” on and off
- You should use a native switch when at all possible vs a custom element, as it will automatically and correctly announce the role without additional development effort
- A toggle should just toggle on or off.  It can add related content to the screen.  Toggling on or off should not automatically navigate the user to another field or screen, which would be a change of context

### Name

- Name describes purpose while focus is in/on the control
- Best practice is to not include "button" in the name
- Name should match the visible label, if any

- **iOS Tips**
	- Set a label in Interface Builder in the Identity Inspector
	- Group visible text label and the control in the same view container: `accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace`
	- `setTitle( )` method
	- If no visible label, use `accessibilityLabel` on control
	- `Hint` is used only if the results of interacting with it are not obvious from the control's label
	- Match visible label, if any
	- To hide labels from VoiceOver announcements, uncheck the Accessibility Enabled checkbox in the Identity Inspector or use `isAccessibilityElement=false`
	- If hiding visible label, use accessibilityLabel on control
- **Android Tips**  
	- `android:text` XML attribute
	- Optional: use `contentDescription` for a more descriptive name, depending on type of view and for elements without a visible label
	- `contentDescription` overrides `android:text`  
	- Use `labelFor` attribute to associate the visible label with the control

### Role

- Role is automatically announced if a native component is used

- **iOS Tips**
	- Standard UISwitchControl
	- "double tap to toggle setting" is expected announcement
- **Android Tips**
	- Standard RadioButton with RadioGroup when applicable
	- "double tap to activate" is expected announcement

### Groupings

- Group visible label with switch (if label is visible)

- **iOS Tips**
	- `accessibilityFrame
	- `accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace`
	- GroupView
	- Only the container class is an accessible element `isAccessibilityElement=true` and announces all elements in one announcement  This makes child elements no longer accessible by screen reader 
- **Android Tips**
	- ViewGroup
	- Set the container object's `android:screenReaderFocusable` attribute to true, and each inner object's `android:focusable` attribute to false. In doing so, accessibility services can present the inner elements' `contentDescription` or names, one after the other, in a single announcement

### State

- States can be selected, dimmed/disabled, on/off

- **iOS Tips**  
	- Active: `isEnabled property`
	- Disabled: `UIAccessibilityTraitNotEnabled`
	- disabled/dimmed
	- on/off:  `isOn` or `setOn`   
	- Announcement: dimmed, on/off, "double tap to toggle setting" 
        
- **Android Tips**
	- Active: `android:enabled=true`
	- Disabled: `android:enabled=false`
	- on/off: `isChecked`, `setChecked`, toggle
	- Announcement: disabled, on/off, "double tap to activate" or "double tap to toggle"

### Focus

- Only manage focus when needed. Primarily, let the device manage default focus order  
- Consider how focus should be managed between child elements and their parent views or containers

- **iOS Tips**
	- `accessibilityElementIsFocused`  
	- `isAccessibilityElement` makes the element visible or not to the Accessibility API
	- `accessibilityElementsHidden` indicates that the children elements of the target element are visible or not to the Accessibility API
	- `accessibilityViewIsModal` contains the screen reader focus inside the Modal
	- To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `UIAccessibilityLayoutChangedNotification`
	- To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `UIAccessibilityAnnouncementNotification`
- **Android Tips**
	- `importantForAccessibility` makes the element visible to the Accessibility API
	- `android:focusable`
	- `android=clickable`
	- Implement an `onClick( )` event handler for keyboard, not `onTouch( )`
	- `nextFocusDown`
	- `nextFocusUp`
	- `nextFocusRight`
	- `nextFocusLeft`
	- `accessibilityTraversalBefore` (or after)
	- To move screen reader focus to newly revealed content: `Type_View_Focused`
	- To NOT move focus, but dynamically announce new content: `accessibilityLiveRegion`(set to polite or assertive)
	- To hide controls: `Important_For_Accessibility_false`
